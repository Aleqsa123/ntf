## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge was to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I used tools mentioned below to  complete the challenge. 
Users are able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size and see hover states for interactive elements.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned laying the elements out, use and insert google fonts. How to insert meta element in html index document for responsive desing usage.

Below are the codes I used, and I think that these are awesome at my level of education in web-development:

```html
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100;400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
```
```css
    .rectangle {
      width: 302px;
      left: 24px;
      top: 514px;
      border-radius: 0px;
      border: 1px solid #2E405A;
      margin-left: 24px;
      margin-top: 14px;
    }

    footer {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
    }

```

### Continued development

I have to work more on CSS layout, because for me this was the hardest part of the challenge.
